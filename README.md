# ImageFilters
Code to manipulate images in various ways, including using K means-clustering to sharpen or reduce the colors within an image. Code for each filter is stored within the ImageFilters.java file. Each filter is pretty self explanatory (ie, blurFilter blurs the image inputing into the function and colorReduceFilter reduces the number of unique colors within an image)
