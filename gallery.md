This Tom is a mad scientist. He has recently discovered interdimensional
travel and I suspect he will find other Toms on the way

I present to you, electric Tom. This is a parallel universe Tom 
who is capable of powering multiple cities in our universe. Unfortunately,
in this Tom's universe, people cannot power appliances.

If you have seen Dr. Strange, you know of the mirror dimension. 
If not I recommend briefly searching it up and looking at some
images. This Tom got stuck in the mirror dimension and has not
been able to escape.

This Tom is just plain weird. He has no special traits, much to
his dismay, but he does look like he has a big brain. I guess he
has that going for him.
